    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Established in 1998, we provide solutions across Mexico and the USA in industrial automation, integration and services for manufacturing and product assembly processes. Our journey began with offering programming services and minor modifications to existing machines.</p>
    <p>Over the years, we expanded our expertise into various areas, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2000, we began offering complete automation solutions, including manual and automatic assembly lines in the automotive industry.</li>
        <li>By 2006, we had started developing new fixtures and manual assembly stations tailored to the automotive sector's needs.</li>
        <li>In 2010, we ventured into full-scale automation development for manual and automatic assembly lines within the automotive industry.</li>
        <li>In 2018, we entered the Honeywell and HBT markets, where we focused on developing automatic assembly lines for their products across different plants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team consists of highly skilled professionals, including project managers, financial analysts, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and software engineers. We also are highly equipped with a total of 8 CNC machining centres, a Wenzel Machine Xorbit Model for measurement by coordinates, a water jet cutting machine, and three 3D Printing Machines.</p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>Our services include design and construction for equipment based on the integration of Programmable Logic Controls and Computer Systems, plus the manufacturing of industrial parts, nests and fixtures through
Autodesk Inventor technologies. Our services are a complete solution in the development of machinery, backed by our 24 years of experience in industrial integration. Over the years, Rusemi has completed a wide range of projects that showcase our expertise in automation and robotics. Here are some highlights:</p>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Fire and Smoke Sensor Assembly Lines</h3>
            <p>2 Lines consisting of 18
and 21 modular stations respectively with conveyor transporting pallets from one station to another having multiple automatic operations from pick and place, assembly, screwdriving, labeling, EOL tests, among others.</p>
            <img src="assets/fireSensorAssemblly.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Fire Alarm Subassembly</h3>
            <p>13 Position Rotary Station composed of component revision, bushing press, terminal insertion, terminal press, continuity
test, labeling and packaging where we replaced 4 manual assembly lines providing savings on labor and precision on the assemblies. Manual stations produced 1 assembly every 17 seconds. Our machine produces 1 assembly every 5.5 seconds (improvement of 309% in cycle time).</p>
            <img src="assets/fireSensorSubassembly.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Headlamp Assembly and Testing</h3>
            <p>9 Position Conveyor for the assembly and testing of modules of high beam and low beam modules for headlamps for American, European and Japanese models. Assembly consists in manual loading, vision component revision, epoxy application, pick and place, electrical testing and automatic screwing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>EOL Station </h3>
            <p>EOL station for high beam and low beam modules for headlamps where client provides module specification,
through LIN commmunication (Vector or HSX card) and then through our algorithm, we upload the specification into ECU for intensity and field of illumination testing. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>CO2 Laser Cutting Station</h3>
            <p>8 Laser cuts of Â½ inch plus laser engraving in the module lenses after they exit molding. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Headlamp Press Station</h3>
            <p>Press station for assembly of O-rings, bulbshields and adjusters into the housing for headlamps. </p>
            <img src="assets/pressStation.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Headlamp Coding and Aiming Station</h3>
            <p>Headlamp end of line, electrical, temperature and continuity testing and final angle, intensity and field of illumination adjustment. </p>
            <img src="assets/aiming.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Glue Cell Station</h3>
            <p>Glue application through 6 axis robot in housing and lens assembly into housing in a 4 position rotary table.</p>
            <img src="assets/glueCell.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-item">
            <h3>Continuity Testing Station</h3>
